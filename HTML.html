        <section>
            <p>On the 13th of August, 2013, a solo game developer known as RobTop games published 'Geometry Dash' (abbreviated to GD), a 2 dimensional platformer game inspired by 'The Impossible Game', a popular game at the time. 
                For most of development the game was actually called Geometry Jump, but the name was changed upon release. 
                After a few months the game would gain a relatively large following, thanks in part to its simple mechanics, which I will lay out here.<p>
                
                </p>Gamemode 1 - Cube
                     The Cube gamemode allowes the player to jump a set distance when pressing either the mouse1, space or up arrow key, or when tapping he screen if played on mobile.</p>

                <p>Gamemode 2 - Ship 
                     The Ship gamemode provides an increase in vertical velocity when a key is held.</p>

                Mechanics:
                The player enters a level from the main menu, and has to use the various gamemodes in different ways to avoid the spikes placed around the level. 
                In a level there may be gamemode portals, which switch you between the ship and cube gamemodes.
                Jump pads boost you up into the air woithout requiring an input, while jump rings (orbs) do require an input to provide this boost.
                Coins can be collected by taking alternative paths or completeing difficult jumps in levels, and can unlock new skins for your icon (charachter).
                Gravity portals reverse the direction the player falls.
                A level editor which allows players to upload things to the servers.
